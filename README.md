# XL4001 3W LED DRIVER
XL4001 based, 3W 5-35V LED Driver 700mA PWM Dimming DC to DC Step-down Constant Current
- XL4001: 2A 150kHz 40V Buck DC/DC Converter With Constant Current Loop
- DC to DC Step-down Constant Current: means that the input voltage will be delivered to the output, but it may decrease as the load current increases.
- - Voltage [v] = Current [I] x Resistance [R]; [(Ohm's law) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law)

(Can be adapted to charge battery)
